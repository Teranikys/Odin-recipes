    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cauliflower</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare all the ingredients (instead of milk, you can take cream).</li>
        <li>Disassemble the cauliflower into medium-sized inflorescence of medium size. The larger the pieces, the longer they will need to be boiled in boiling water.</li>
        <li>In a separate container, mix milk, egg, ground red and black peppers. Also add mustard, garlic powder and a pinch of salt. Mix everything thoroughly with a fork or whisk. At this stage, you can add your favorite spices to taste.</li>
        <li>Gradually add flour to the egg-milk mass and stir constantly so that no lumps form. This will take about two tablespoons of flour. The batter should not be very liquid.</li>
        <li>Boil about 1-1.5 liters of water in a saucepan, add a pinch of salt. Send cauliflower inflorescence to boiling water. After boiling, reduce the fire, cook everything for about five minutes. The readiness of the inflorescence can be checked with a toothpick or fork. The main thing is not to digest, otherwise it may turn out to be porridge.</li>
        <li>Throw the cooked cabbage into a colander, cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Dip each inflorescence from all sides in batter.</li>
        <li>Then dip in the remaining flour in the same way on all sides.</li>
        <li>Heat sunflower oil in a frying pan. It is better to take a frying pan with a small size, but with high edges, so less oil is required, and it will be more convenient to cook cabbage. Fry the cauliflower in boiling oil over high heat on each side for a few seconds. Place cooked cabbage florets on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
