<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Cook canned potatoes in an air fryer to make these alternative roasties. Though they're not the same as oven-cooked, they do turn golden and crisp
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can peeled potatoes in water</li>
  <li>Sunflower or vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander, rinse and leave to drain again. Meanwhile, heat the air fryer for 2-3 mins at
   190C. Put the potatoes in a bowl and drizzle over the oil. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, plus any other seasonings you like (see tip, below).</li>
 <li>Mix well so the potatoes are fully coated in the oil and seasoning. Transfer to the air fryer basket and cook for 20-25 mins until golden and crisp.</li>
